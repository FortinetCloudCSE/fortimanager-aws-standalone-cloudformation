Before attempting to create a stack with the template, a few prerequisites should be checked to ensure a successful deployment:
1.	An AMI subscription must be active for the FortiManager license type being used in the template.
    * [**BYOL Marketplace Listing**](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-l6rxheua5mbls)
    * [**PAYG (Max 2 Devices) Marketplace Listing**](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-sxkylaodc2l5s)
    * [**PAYG (Max 10 Devices) Marketplace Listing**](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-4rgupihrc4lgq)
    * [**PAYG (Max 30 Devices) Marketplace Listing**](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-mnbyo52dmz6u2)
    * [**PAYG (Max 100 Devices) Marketplace Listing**](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gwsitrlo2omam)
    * [**PAYG (Max 500 Devices) Marketplace Listing**](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-rxno6bnhvz4xi)

2.	The solution requires 1 EIP to be created so ensure the AWS region being used has available capacity.  Reference [**AWS Documentation**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) for more information on EC2 resource limits and how to request increases.

3.	If BYOL licensing is to be used, ensure these licenses have been registered on the support site.

4.   **Create a new S3 bucket in the same region where the template will be deployed.  If the bucket is in a different region than the template deployment, bootstrapping will fail.**

5.  If BYOL licensing is to be used, upload these licenses to the root directory of the same S3 bucket from the step above.

6.  If the FMG will be publicly available, **ensure that the PublicSubnet's AWS route table has a default route to an AWS Internet Gateway, otherwise bootstrapping will fail.**  Reference [**AWS Documentation**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#route-tables-internet-gateway) for further information. 

7.  If the FMG will not be publicly available, **ensure that a S3 gateway endpoint is deployed and assigned to the subnet's AWS route table the FMG will be deployed into**. Otherwise, provide the relevant route table ID and the template will deploy a S3 gateway endpoint for you.  Reference [**AWS Documentation**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) for further information.
